# CLAUDE.md — cli-series

**Organization rules (mandatory): https://github.com/nlink-jp/.github/blob/main/CONVENTIONS.md**

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Tests are mandatory** — write them with the implementation. A feature is not complete without tests.
- **Design for testability** — pure functions, injected dependencies, no untestable globals.
- **Docs in sync** — update `README.md` and `README.ja.md` in the same commit as behaviour changes.
- **Small, typed commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `security:`
